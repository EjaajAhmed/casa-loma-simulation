# casa-loma-simulation
A simulation based on my time working as a porter at Casa Loma, a tourist attraction that, yes, is a castle.

Users may pass time and change rooms. Users are also equipped with a health bar, a unique name and multiple other attributes. NPCs are present and will offer tasks or conversation. 

This project showcases data structures, object oriented programming and many other java applications while following common programming etiquette. It is an ongoing project that allows me to refine my programming skills while also serving as a memento to my time working at my part-time job.

Future updates will be added.
